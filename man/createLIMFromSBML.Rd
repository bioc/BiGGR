\usage{createLIMFromSBML(model, maximize, equations=NULL, inequalities=NULL,
		constraints=NULL, externals=NULL, file.name="model.lim")}

\arguments{

\item{model}{an SBML object of reactions/metabolites participating in a metabolic pathway.}

\item{maximize}{
a character vector consisting the tag of the reaction(s) to be maximized or minimized
}
\item{equations}{
a \code{list} specifying equality constraints on the system.
The list must have two entries, the first one being a
vector of class \code{character} containing the left hand side(s) of
the equation(s), the second one being a vector of type
\code{character} or \code{mumeric} with the right hand side(s) of
the equation(s). See also 'examples'.
}
\item{inequalities}{
a \code{list} specifying inequality constraints on the system.
The list must have three entries, the first one being a
vector of class \code{character} containing the left hand side(s) of
the inequality equation(s), the second one being a vector of type
\code{character} or \code{mumeric} with the right hand side(s) of
the inequality equation(s) and the third one being a vector of class
\code{character} containing the relational operator of the
inequality equations, for example \code{">"} or \code{"<="}. See
also 'examples'.
}
\item{constraints}{
a \code{list} specifying constrained on the solution space of the
flux vector. The list must have three entries, the first one being
a vector of class \code{character} with the reaction id(s) to be
constrained, the second and third one a \code{numeric} vector with
the lower and upper flux bounds, respectively,  for the reactions to be contrained.
is a character vector specifying the minimum and maximum values(boundary) under which the solution for the 	\code{maximize} reaction should fall
}
\item{externals}{
a character vector of metabolites as provided by the user for speficific pathways for which FBA (flux balance analysis needs to be performed)
}
\item{file.name}{
a character string specifying the name of the LIM file created by
the function.
}
}

\value{A model file with with extension \code{".lim"} is created}
